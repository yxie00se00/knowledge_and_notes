# Knowledge and Notes

This repo is aimed at maintaining part of my works (mostly notes, maybe some essays as well) in scientific and mathematical areas.

Most of these works are not the so-called state-of-the-art. They should just be records of what I have thought of, come up and practiced on. They might contain pieces of knowledge or information that are not rigorous, or specific, or even up-to-date. They are also not guaranteed to be technically fully understandable by the public, though I would surely like to work on readability.

Welcome anyone who would like to take time reading through these works. If you are interested by the contents, please feel free to leave comments or send me emails. However, reproducing without my permission is prohibited.
